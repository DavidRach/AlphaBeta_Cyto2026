Spectral flow cytometry (SFC) holds enormous potential to profile immune systems at both breadth and depth previously untennable/impractical/unreachable. For human neonatal immunology research, where there are only a finite number of cryopreserved specimens with variable cell counts, SFC may permit for a more thorough dissection of the observed heterogeneity in immune responses during the early life period following immunization or infection.

For modern cytometrist, this promise of increased capacity to characterize comes at the cost of needing to account for increased uncertainty, primarily arising from how marker abundance is estimated during unmixing. Regardless of whether it is introduced by additional or varied autofluorescence, non-specific binding or tandem degradaton of fluorophores, or simply increased  unmixing-dependent spread due to co-expression of markers on rare subsets, this uncertainty actively shapes our datasets. Developing bioinformatic methods to distinguish heterogeneity from underlying technical artifacts is key to unlocking SFC's full potential. 
 
But beyond resolution, how to analyze the richness of SFC datasets remains a challenge. Leveraging the "forest from the trees" analogy, while gating for pre-determined cell populations of interest remains viable, we risk constraining our analyses to looking for particular species of tree. This narrow focus precludes our ability to detect meaninful changes in other cell populations within the immunological forest that is our samples. Likewise, while existing unsupervised methods permit capturing a broader picture, many are the equivalent of viewing a single satellite picture of the entire forest, with uncertainty dictating the final resolution. 

We highlight how we address these challenges in our work evaluating the immune responses of a cohort of Malawian infants with well-characterized prenatal HIV-exposure. This consisted of three groups of infants born to women with: A) ART-treated HIV infection and undetectable viral load since before conception and through pregnancy (HEU-lo); B) HIV infection diagnosed and treated at mid-gestation or later, with high viral load at enrollment (HEU-hi); C) no HIV infection (HU). 

We collected cord blood mononuclear cells at birth, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 4 and 9-months following routine childhood immunizations. Cryopreserved samples were thawed, rested for 6 hours, before being stimulated in the presence of purified protein derrivative (PPD) or Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) for 11 hours. Cells were then processed and stained with a 32-color intranuclear SFC panel to characterize phenotype, activation-induced marker and cytokine production. Cells were acquired the same day on a 5-laser Cytek Aurora that had passed an enhanced instrument QC criteria.

Following acquisition, we carried out a semi-supervised analysis with a custom pipeline that we implemented in R and Rust. Briefly, we screened unmixing controls using the Luciernaga and PeacoQC R packages, replacing problematic single-colors and incorporating additional autofluoresce controls as appropiate before unmixing.

Samples were biexponentially transformed and automated gating for predefined cell populations was implemented using the openCyto and flowMagic R packages. Using the interactive Shiny App in our R package Coereba, split-point between positive and negative events for each given marker and individual calculated by the automated gating were visualized and manually adjusted as needed. Identity columns for the marker expression of individual cells were then generated and incorporated into the .fcs files. 

For particular cell populations of interest, all events were concatenated, normalized with CytoNorm v2, clustered with flowSOM, and dimensionality visualized with PaCMAP. Incorporated identify data from cells that ended up within individual islands or clusters was retrieved, allowing evaluation algorithm performance vs. manual gating. In parallel, cells enumerated into clusters on basis of shared marker identity were analyzed for differential abundance using existing Bioconductor workflows. 

We leverage both approaches to examine the immune system across each timepoint,treatment condition, and where applicable, longitudinally. This permitted an exhaustive characterization that was scalable and allows for greater understanding of what occurring within the immunological forest.
